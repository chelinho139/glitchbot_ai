# ü§ñ GlitchBot - AI Twitter Agent

**GlitchBot** is an autonomous Twitter bot powered by the Virtuals G.A.M.E (Generative Autonomous Multi-Agent Engine) framework. Built with a sophisticated 3-level architecture, GlitchBot delivers intelligent, contextual social media engagement focused on DeFi, AI, and emerging technologies.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

GlitchBot implements the complete 3-level G.A.M.E hierarchy:

### üìã **Level 1: GameAgent (High-Level Planner)**

- **GlitchBotAgent** - Strategic decision making and goal prioritization
- Orchestrates multiple specialized workers
- Makes high-level decisions about engagement strategy
- Manages sleep schedules and system-wide priorities

### ‚ö° **Level 2: GameWorkers (Specialized Task Execution)**

#### **Twitter Workers (Social Media Operations)**

- **üî• MentionsWorker** - _CRITICAL Priority_

  - Real-time response to mentions and DMs (< 5 minutes)
  - Intent recognition and cross-worker task delegation
  - Community relationship building
  - Handles "@GlitchBot check this tweet" scenarios

- **üìà EngagementWorker** - _HIGH Priority_

  - Proactive content creation and quote tweets
  - Strategic replies to valuable conversations
  - Respects 2-hour cadence for quotes, 60s for replies
  - Quality-focused content strategy (score > 15/20)

- **üîç DiscoveryWorker** - _MEDIUM Priority_
  - Continuous content discovery and curation
  - Multi-source scanning (keywords, accounts, trending)
  - Intelligent content scoring and filtering
  - Handles priority analysis requests from other workers

#### **System Workers (Infrastructure Management)**

- **üìä MonitoringWorker** - _LOW Priority_

  - System health and performance monitoring
  - API rate limit tracking and alerts
  - Error pattern analysis and reporting
  - Performance optimization insights

- **üßπ MaintenanceWorker** - _LOW Priority_

  - Database cleanup and optimization
  - Log rotation and storage management
  - Scheduled maintenance during sleep windows
  - Data integrity validation and backups

- **ü§ù CoordinationWorker** - _MEDIUM Priority_
  - Cross-worker communication and task routing
  - Resource conflict resolution
  - Shared state synchronization
  - System-wide event broadcasting

### üîß **Level 3: GameFunctions (Atomic Actions)**

#### **Atomic Functions (Single-Purpose)**

- **Social/Twitter**: `fetch_mentions`, `search_tweets`, `post_tweet`, `like_tweet`, `send_dm`
- **Analytics**: `score_content`, `analyze_sentiment`, `track_engagement`
- **Utilities**: `check_cadence`, `validate_content`, `manage_locks`

#### **Workflow Functions (Multi-Step Processes)**

- **`quote_tweet_workflow`**: Complete quote tweet process with commentary
- **`reply_workflow`**: Context-aware reply generation and posting
- **`discovery_workflow`**: Multi-source content discovery and scoring

## üîó Global Coordination Layer

### **EngagementTracker**

- Prevents duplicate engagement across workers
- Tracks engagement history and success patterns
- Coordinates system-wide engagement strategy

### **ReservationManager**

- Manages shared resource access (content, API quotas, DB connections)
- Priority-based resource allocation
- Queue management for high-demand resources

### **RateLimiter**

- Intelligent API usage distribution across workers
- Fair share allocation with priority overrides
- Predictive throttling and optimal request scheduling

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- TypeScript
- Twitter API access (v2)
- Virtuals G.A.M.E API key

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

cp env.example .env

# Configure your environment variables
# VIRTUALS_API_KEY=your_api_key
# GAME_TWITTER_TOKEN=your_token (or Twitter app keys)
```

### Development

```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Build project

```

## üéØ Bot Behavior & Strategy

### **Engagement Strategy**

- **Quote Tweets**: High-impact content (score 15+) with thoughtful commentary
- **Strategic Replies**: Value-added contributions to important conversations
- **Community Building**: Responsive interaction with mentions and DMs
- **Thought Leadership**: Insights on DeFi, AI, Web3, and emerging tech

### **Content Discovery**

- **Keyword Monitoring**: DeFi, AI, Web3, GameFi, innovation terms
- **Account Watching**: Key influencers and thought leaders
- **Trending Analysis**: Viral content in relevant spaces
- **Community Curation**: User-suggested content analysis

### **Quality Standards**

- **Content Scoring**: 20-point scale based on relevance, engagement, authority
- **Timing Intelligence**: Optimal posting times and cadence management
- **Brand Consistency**: Authentic, helpful, technically insightful voice
- **Community Focus**: Building relationships over metrics

### **Operational Rules**

- **Sleep Schedule**: 05:00-13:00 UTC (quiet hours)
- **Quote Cadence**: Minimum 2 hours between quote tweets
- **Reply Cadence**: Minimum 60 seconds between replies (relaxed for mentions)
- **API Respect**: Intelligent rate limiting and error handling

## üìä Worker Coordination Examples

### **User-Directed Content Analysis**

```
User: "@GlitchBot check out this DeFi innovation: [tweet_link]"
     ‚Üì
MentionsWorker: Detects intent, delegates to DiscoveryWorker
     ‚Üì
CoordinationWorker: Routes priority analysis request
     ‚Üì
DiscoveryWorker: Performs priority content analysis
     ‚Üì
MentionsWorker: Reports results back to user
```

### **Cross-Worker Content Flow**

```
DiscoveryWorker: Finds high-quality content (score 18/20)
     ‚Üì
EngagementTracker: Reserves content for quote tweet
     ‚Üì
EngagementWorker: Creates thoughtful quote with commentary
     ‚Üì
RateLimiter: Ensures API quota availability
     ‚Üì
Post published & engagement tracked
```

## üîß Configuration

### **Environment Variables**

```bash
# Required
VIRTUALS_API_KEY=your_virtuals_api_key

# Twitter Authentication (choose one method)
GAME_TWITTER_TOKEN=your_game_twitter_token
# OR
TWITTER_APP_KEY=your_app_key
TWITTER_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret

# Optional
DATABASE_PATH=./glitchbot.db
LOG_LEVEL=info
OWNER_HANDLE=your_handle
NODE_ENV=production
```

### **Worker Priorities**

- **CRITICAL**: MentionsWorker (< 5 min response time)
- **HIGH**: EngagementWorker (strategic content creation)
- **MEDIUM**: DiscoveryWorker, CoordinationWorker (background processing)
- **LOW**: MonitoringWorker, MaintenanceWorker (system maintenance)

## üìà Performance & Monitoring
