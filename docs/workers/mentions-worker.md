## üé≠ Use Case Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Content Suggestion**

```
User: "@GlitchBot check out this amazing DeFi protocol: [tweet_link]"

MentionsWorker Response:
1. Immediate: "Thanks! I'll take a look at that DeFi protocol üëÄ"
2. Delegate: Send priority analysis request to DiscoveryWorker
3. Follow-up: Report analysis results back to user
```

### **Scenario 2: Technical Question**

```
User: "@GlitchBot what's your take on the new AI agent frameworks?"

MentionsWorker Response:
1. Analyze: Classify as technical question
2. Generate: Create thoughtful, informed response
3. Post: Share insights on AI agent frameworks
4. Track: Record interaction for relationship building
```

### **Scenario 3: Conversation Thread**

```
User: "@GlitchBot that's interesting, but what about the security implications?"

MentionsWorker Response:
1. Context: Retrieve previous conversation context
2. Analyze: Understand follow-up question
3. Generate: Contextual response about security
4. Maintain: Continue conversation thread
```

### **Scenario 4: Error Handling**

```
User: "@GlitchBot why aren't you responding to my mentions?"

MentionsWorker Response:
1. Diagnose: Check system status and recent activity
2. Acknowledge: "I apologize for the delay! Let me check what happened"
3. Investigate: Query MonitoringWorker for system issues
4. Escalate: If needed, notify owner via DM
```

## üîÑ Cross-Worker Coordination

### **Delegation to DiscoveryWorker**

```typescript
// When user suggests content for analysis
await this.delegateToDiscovery({
  action: "priority_analysis",
  tweet_id: suggestedTweetId,
  requested_by: mention.author.username,
  mention_id: mention.id,
  urgency: "high",
});
```

### **Coordination with EngagementWorker**

```typescript
// For complex technical discussions
await this.delegateToEngagement({
  action: "generate_thoughtful_reply",
  context: conversationThread,
  user_question: mention.text,
  priority: "high",
});
```

### **System Monitoring Integration**

```typescript
// When system issues are detected
await this.escalateToMonitoring({
  issue_type: "response_delay",
  user_affected: mention.author.username,
  severity: "medium",
});
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

### **Response Time Tracking**

- **Target**: < 5 minutes for mentions, immediate for DMs
- **Measurement**: Time from mention to first response
- **Alerting**: > 10 minutes triggers escalation

### **Engagement Quality**

- **User satisfaction**: Track follow-up interactions
- **Conversation depth**: Number of exchanges per thread
- **Relationship building**: User return rate and engagement

### **Delegation Effectiveness**

- **Task routing accuracy**: Correct worker selection
- **Response quality**: Quality of delegated responses
- **User satisfaction**: Feedback on delegated interactions

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

### **API Failures**

- **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff for temporary failures
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue with cached data if needed
- **User notification**: Inform users of temporary issues

### **System Overload**

- **Priority queuing**: Critical mentions get priority
- **Load shedding**: Defer non-critical interactions
- **Escalation**: Notify owner of high load situations

### **Content Issues**

- **Sensitivity detection**: Flag controversial content
- **Escalation**: Route sensitive topics to human review
- **User guidance**: Help users understand bot limitations

## üîß Configuration

### **Response Templates**

```typescript
const RESPONSE_TEMPLATES = {
  content_suggestion: "Thanks! I'll take a look at that {topic} üëÄ",
  technical_question: "Great question about {topic}! Here's my take...",
  conversation: "That's an interesting point about {topic}...",
  error_apology: "I apologize for the delay! Let me check what happened.",
};
```

### **Escalation Rules**

```typescript
const ESCALATION_TRIGGERS = {
  controversial_topics: ["politics", "religion", "personal_attacks"],
  technical_complexity: ["advanced_programming", "system_architecture"],
  user_complaints: ["not_responding", "wrong_answers", "rude_behavior"],
};
```

### **Delegation Priorities**

```typescript
const DELEGATION_PRIORITIES = {
  content_analysis: "high",
  technical_questions: "medium",
  general_chat: "low",
  system_issues: "critical",
};
```

## üéØ Success Criteria
